# Project5_Othello_Players

Project 5 is the Passion Project (as well as final project) where all the choices belong to each individual student.

As a big fan of various board games like Othello, Go, Chess, I decided to create my own AI Othello players using Python. I referred Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming by Peter Norvig and many academic papers.

* Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming by Peter Norvig
* Searching Algorithms in Playing Othello by Zhifei Zhang and Yuechuan Chen
* Q-Learning for a Simple Board Game by Oskar Arbidsson and Linus Wallgren
* Reinforcement Learning in the Game of Othello: Learning Against a Fixed Opponent and Learning from Self-Play by Michiel van der Ree and Marco Wiering


#### Step1: Set up board, black & white pieces and rules on python using class and functions 

#### Step2: Apply algorithms to each players (random, local maximization, and minimax with depth=2,3,4,5,6..)

#### Step3: Compare the winning odds and computing time of each strategies 

#### Step4: Train a deep q-learning algorithm player. 
Apply Convolution Neural Network techniques to q-functions. 
(Ongoing process...)
